            <p id="intro_text"> Being an undergraduate student studying computer science (CS) at the University of Colorado Boulder, I have had first hand experience with artificial intelligence
               (AI) and its effect in the industry. Just a few years ago, it seemed as if anyone who could write a single line of code was handed a job. This could not be any further from true 
               today. With the increasing population of computer scientists within universities the job market has become extremely competitive. As for AI, computer scientists not only know AI as a 
               tool but also a competitor. AI’s ability to write and debug code has made it better at coding than some entry level computer scientists.  </p>
            <p id = "intro_text">The risk of AI replacing computer scientists is not a quiet topic. Even those outside of the CS field have likely heard the commentary surrounding the impact AI 
              has had on the CS job market. With this commentary in mind, those unfamiliar with AI may fail to understand why and how AI is impacting the work industry. AI’s massive scale reaches 
              far more than just the computer science field. Even those majoring in topics unrelated and inexperienced with AI will indirectly be affected. Why and how these undergrads will still 
              have a relationship with AI is important for their industry understanding. This infographic will serve to help those without AI knowledge understand its industry impact when job searching.</p>
