          <h2>Will AI affect my job search?</h2>
          <p>Despite seeming unrelated, governments are incorporating AI policy that is affecting the work industry. All sizes of governments, from state to NATO, have taken charge to produce a 
            variety of policies surrounding the topic. Without knowing much about AI, what should you take away from this?</p>
            <p>Even though AI may not be used by you or your discipline, you can still expect it to likely be integrated into the companies you are applying for in some way. The United States has 
              enforced a policy to produce computer chips in hopes to drive more use of AI within companies specifically. While doing so, the States are monitoring AI’s effects on unemployment and 
              the labor market. Because the States are analysing AI’s effect on the job market, you should not stress much about AI replacing your job. This should put your mind at ease that the 
              government is acknowledging the risk and plan to keep an eye on it. With that being said, because AI is being integrated into more and more companies and fields, you should do brief 
              research on it. Look into if or how it is used in your field. This will only help you when applying for jobs. You will understand more about your field and company, and open up more 
              questions you can ask in interviews.
